# p5-bouncing-balls

Requires P5 JS to work. Remove the `makenote()` calls when not using HKU's CSDOSC framework.

Left mouse button creates a new ball. Spacebar turns gravity on or off. Enter resets the balls' speed to the initial value. Backspace removes the newest ball. Delete removes all balls. 1 and 2 select gravity modes.
